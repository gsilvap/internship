\subsection{Management}

\iftoggle{long}{\red{In this section is described the planning of work developed in this dissertation.}}

\subsubsection{Meetings}
About the meetings, the supervisor Raul Barbosa and I agreed that meeting once every week was the best option. Moreover they happened, with one or another change of schedule to reconcile with the other activities from both. In addition, I attended some general meetings of the project. In them, we could discuss concepts and the direction of the project with colleagues and teachers, among them: Raul Barbosa (supervisor), Henrique Madeira (co-supervisor), João Durães and João André Ferro.

\subsubsection{Risks}

The main-risks of execution of this project are:

\iftoggle{long}{\red{desenvolver um pouco mais...}}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Equipment Failure;
	\item Data lost;
	\item Publication of similar research;
	\item Personal issues interfering with the progress;
	\item Student loses interest;
	\item Dispute between student and supervisor;
	\item Supervisor takes excessive time to check final drafts;
	\item Student wants to submit thesis without supervisor approval.
\end{itemize}

\iftoggle{long}{\red{Speak about the cause, consequence and mitigation described in table of risks!!!}}

The preventative measures and recovery measures can be seen at Appendix \ref{App:B} in other perspective.

\subsubsection{Planning and Tracking}
In Appendix \ref{App:A}, is showed the Gantt diagram with the tasks that have been done during the first semester.
%  to first and to second semester.I'm not showing here the planned Gantt
As I postponed this dissertation for six months so, the scope and the context have changed. Now the two Gantt diagrams are incomparable.


%I have prioritized the tasks using the nomenclature in Table \ref{tab:classRequirements}:
