Nowadays, the Information and Communications Technologies are responsible for 2-4\% of CO\textsuperscript{2} emissions, but in the next five or ten years these will increase to 10\% \cite{wolter2012resilience}. Because of this, the next challenge is reduce the costs of ICT and its impact in the environment while keeps the growing of IC services.


Cloud computing is a novel paradigm that provides on-demand self-service resources (computing, network and storage). It also promises to reduce the costs of ICT, but isn't free of external disturbance like security attacks, power surges, workload faults and others.

Therefore, the theme of my dissertation is ``Evaluate the robustness of Cloud''. I will design and implement a fault injector for software coded in C to evaluate the capacity of cloud to recover from faults.\\

%The main goal of my dissertation is inject faults in code of applications, compile them and evaluate the results.
