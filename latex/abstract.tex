Nowadays, the Information and Communication Technologies are responsible for 2-4\% of CO\textsuperscript{2} emissions, but in the next five or ten years these will increase to 10\% \cite{wolter2012resilience}. Because of this, the next challenge is to reduce the costs of ICT and its impact in the environment while the IC services keep growing.


Cloud computing is a new paradigm that provides on-demand self-service resources (computing, network and storage). It also promises to reduce the costs of ICT, but isn't free of external disturbance like security attacks, power surges, workload faults and others.

Therefore, the theme of my dissertation is ``Evaluate the robustness of the Cloud''. I will design and implement a fault injector for software coded in C to evaluate the capacity of the cloud to recover from faults.\\
